            <p >
                In the past, agents used to register their personal advertisements without any charges on the platform. However, with the rising costs of the platform, the company now plans to implement a purchasing mechanism, allowing agents to buy advertising spaces for real estate projects they are interested in.

                    In the initial ideation stage, I, along with a junior designer and PM, focused on the visibility of these new products. Through these interactions, we tried to understand what real estate agents might care about after advertising.

                The slight difference in scores between these two versions indicates that there are areas in both user experiences that need improvement. During the user testing( A/B ) and interviews, out of the 9 participants, 8 leaned towards the A version. It's worth noting that agents are highly sensitive to competitiveness, especially for properties in popular areas, and their response was overwhelmingly positive. This was something we hadn't realised in the past.

                In this feedback round, has been incredibly valuable for our product as it helped clarify what agent have in mind and how they interact with each page. This research will guide us in iterating on our UI, with a focus on using Version A as our primary reference. It has also helped redefine the design metrics we should prioritise.
