                    <p>
                        I have undertaken a diverse range of tasks, such as establishing internal UX processes, developing design systems, conducting stakeholder and user interviews, quality assurance, creating wireframes, and building prototypes.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    I collaborated with clients and project managers to create effective designs and solutions that met the needs of users. I was involved in stakeholder meetings to showcase the designs and to ensure their satisfaction. I also worked closely with the internal design team and in-house developers to make sure that we were all aligned on the project's goals.

                        As the sole UX designer in the company, I was given ample opportunities to lead projects and grow my expertise in the field. I took ownership of the UX research process and tailored it to fit each project's specific requirements, allowing me to continuously develop my skills and knowledge. This versatility has enabled me to effectively find and implement optimal solutions for a range of projects.

                <h3>My “UX process”</h3>
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                  <p>  I have the experience of working in both large corporations and small agencies. While working in a small agency, I had the opportunity to create a UX process from scratch and establish a structured approach to UX design. This allowed me to lead projects with ease, maintain consistency and work more efficiently. I documented each stage of the process to ensure easy accessibility and understanding, while also being able to define an agile approach and provide clear timelines for each UX phase of the project. </p>

                    <p>
                     I broke down the UX design process into phases, creating wireframes at 30%, 60%, and 90% completion stages. This approach enabled me to gather necessary copy, content, and assets incrementally while building up the structure and features of the design. With each iteration, the wireframes became more comprehensive, providing a solid foundation for the UI team to take over seamlessly, ensuring a smooth transition in the design process. </p>

                   <p> In my projects, I prioritize teamwork, ensuring everyone collaborates effectively. Together, we map out user journeys, anticipate challenges, and come up with innovative solutions, resulting in dynamic designs that meet user needs. I also ensure developers receive clear documentation and tags, clarifying the purpose and importance of each UX element.</p>
